c1, c2, c3: the number of elements of the respective component

p1, p2, p3: number of products

gain = revenue - cost
revenue = 30 * p1 + 28 * p2 + 24 * p3
cost = p1 * (2*2 + 5*4) + p2 * (4*2 + 6*3) + p3 * (2*4 + 1*3)

constraints:
c1 = 2*p1 + 4*p2 <= 800
c2 = 5*p1 + 2*p3 <= 900
c3 = 6*p2 + 1*p3 <= 1300

-> probably we don't need th4e c_vars
